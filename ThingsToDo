We need to:
	1.) Implement Thread conversation
	2.) Push from tablet to server
	3.) Retrieve from server to phone
	4.) Make EditText widths stay the same
	5.) Reverse the order of the list (make oldest item on bottom, newest item added to top)
		-May have to implement our own ListView class. 
	6.) Distinguish between Sent message and recieved message
		-Change color? 
		-Move the sent items to the right side of screen
			-Will need a new message row item
	7.) Add a Progress bar in the actionbar that is only visible when loading from the server.
