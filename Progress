Looked into StackMob. I really like StackMob because of some of their features: custom API’s, social integration, OAuth support…but it doesn’t fully support Android yet. Perhaps in the future, we can use that, but for now I think we will stick with Parse. I am adding in user registration and login. A new launcher screen has been added, as well as a login page as well as registration activity. Working on registering a user now.
