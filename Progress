Looked into StackMob. I really like StackMob because of some of their features: custom API’s, social integration, OAuth support…but it doesn’t fully support Android yet. Perhaps in the future, we can use that, but for now I think we will stick with Parse. I am adding in user registration and login. A new launcher screen has been added, as well as a login page as well as registration activity. Working on registering a user now.

	-Moved lookup into AsyncTask. 
		-It works, but the AsyncTask.Status is always RUNNING. I believe it needs to be FINISHED in order to do registration.
	-Reworked entire RegistrationActivity to accomodate Asynctask.
	-Changed the name of the SharedPrefs.  
	
	TODO: 
		•Move Registration to AsyncTask as well. 			
		•Encrypt passwords
		•Check if user is logged in. If they are, do not go to login screen. If not, go to login screen.		
		•Work on MainHoneycombActivity to display messages and send them.
